This script is stupid simple.. But makes it easy to delete chat logs on your (or your employers) apple computer. I found this task tedious and repetitive and not as easy as it should be.

To use, save the file to your DESKTOP as simply "remove_chat_logs" (no extension).

Then open terminal, and type this in:

# chmod +x $HOME/Desktop/remove_chat_logs
    please note: if for some strange reason you do not have the path variable $HOME defined, 
    just change the above line to read:
    # chmod +x "/Users/YOURNAMEHERE/Desktop/remove_chat_logs"
    
    
If for some reason it does not turn into an executable file (it should).. Then run this command in terminal to execute the script:

# open -b com.apple.terminal $HOME/Desktop/remove_chat_logs

Otherwise, just double click the file.




This *should* create a shell executable file you can double click to run anytime. If not, use the command above.
I use the terminal command because its faster and easier for me.

Note- no files will ever be deleted without you first giving the OK. 

Keep the file on the desktop (or wherever you want to put it) and run it as often as you want.

Thanks and thanks.
