This script is stupid simple.. But makes it easy to delete chat logs on your (or your employers) apple computer. I found this task tedious and repetitive and not as easy as it should be.

To use, save the file to your DESKTOP as simply "remove_chat_logs" (no extension).

Then open terminal, and type this in:

# chmod -x “$HOME/Desktop/remove_chat_logs"
    please note: if for some strange reason you do not have the path variable $HOME defined, 
    just change the above line to read:
    # chmod -x “/Users/YOURNAMEHERE/Desktop/remove_chat_logs"
    
This will create a shell executable file you can double click to run anytime.

Note- no files will ever be deleted without you first giving the OK. 

Keep the file on the desktop (or wherever you want to put it) and run it as often as you want.

Thanks and thanks.
