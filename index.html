<p><strong>iMessage log files are annoying on MacOS</strong>. There is no simple way to disable them by default in the application. So instead, this script will let you rest easy knowing your boss will not find your work-hours chat log to your girlfriend (or drug dealer.. if thats your thing. heh)</p>

<p>This script is stupid simple.. But makes it easy to delete chat logs on your (or your employers) apple computer. I found this task tedious and repetitive and not as easy as it should be.</p>

<h3>
<a name="to-use" class="anchor" href="#to-use"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To use:</h3>

<p>Save the file to your hard drive as simply "remove_chat_logs" (no extension). It is already an executable file, so just double click it and follow the instructions.</p>




<p><strong>Now</strong>, <em>just double click the file.</em></p>

<p><strong>Note- no files will ever be deleted without you first giving the OK.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Keep the file on the desktop (or wherever you want to put it) and run it as often as you want.</strong></p>

<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:joshpopenyc@gmail.com">joshpopenyc@gmail.com</a> if you have questions. Or if you have hatemail. I'm always up for a good read.</p>

<p>Thanks and <strong>thanks</strong>.</p>
