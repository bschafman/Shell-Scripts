{"name":"Shell-scripts","tagline":"Scripts I use to automate some common tasks around MacOS","body":"# REMOVE ALL iMessage logs in MacOS\r\nThis script is stupid simple.. But makes it easy to delete chat logs on your (or your employers) apple computer. I found this task tedious and repetitive and not as easy as it should be.\r\n\r\n### To use:\r\nSave the file to your DESKTOP as simply \"remove_chat_logs\" (no extension). Follow these instructions to create an executable file. Or if that fails, use the below command to run the script from terminal.\r\n\r\nThen open terminal, and type this in:\r\n```\r\nchmod -x $HOME/Desktop/remove_chat_logs\r\n  // please note: if for some strange reason you do not have the path variable $HOME defined, \r\n  // just change the above line to read:\r\nchmod -x \"/Users/YOURNAMEHERE/Desktop/remove_chat_logs\"\r\n```    \r\n\r\nIf it does not turn into an executable file.. Then run this command in terminal to execute the script:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nopen -b com.apple.terminal $HOME/Desktop/remove_chat_logs\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**Otherwise**, _just double click the file._\r\n\r\nThis *should* create a shell executable file you can double click to run anytime. \r\nIf not, use the command above.\r\n\r\n**I use the terminal command because its faster and easier for me.**\r\n\r\n**Note- no files will ever be deleted without you first giving the OK.**\r\n\r\n**Keep the file on the desktop (or wherever you want to put it) and run it as often as you want.**\r\n\r\nEmail me at joshpopenyc@gmail.com if you have questions. Or if you have hatemail. I'm always up for a good read.\r\n\r\nThanks and **thanks**.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
