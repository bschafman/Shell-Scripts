Shell-Scripts for MacOS
=============

Scripts I use to automate tasks I normally have to do by hand. Starting with my script to find and remove ALL iMessage log files on MacOS.

This includes any logs saved from iMessage on MacOS, and any log files transferred from an iOS devices to MacOS via iTunes.
